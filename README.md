# portfolio project

this is my portfolio project for Google Udacity Front-End Dev. Challenge

# Current problem: 
when I run `grunt` it returns:

```
Running "responsive_images:dev" (responsive_images) task
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
```

All the file names and syntax in `Gruntfile.js` seems correct, right?

Also, I've tried running it with the package versions of node, npm, 
grunt and grunt plugins: grunt-responsive-images, grunt-contrib-clean, grunt-mkdir 
that are used in:
 - Project-Part-1-Start-min
 - Project-Part-1-Start-min

Yet the same thing also happened with 'grunt-contrib-clean'. That was resolved when I re-installed node, npm, and plugins while trying the versions specified in Project-Part-3 files.
